# AutoRun
[![MSBuild](https://github.com/F0903/AutoRun/actions/workflows/msbuild.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/F0903/AutoRun/actions/workflows/msbuild.yml)
A small program that lets you auto run in any game.

To start, simply launch the app. A console window will pop up, which you can minimize if you wish.
Next, jump into your game of choice, and press SHIFT+ALT+A to start running. 
To stop again, press the hotkey again, or simply press the W key.

If you'd like to sprint instead of run, simply type 'sprint enable'.

This should work for any game, as it works by simulating holding the W key.
If you come upon any issues getting it to work, feel free to start an issue.
